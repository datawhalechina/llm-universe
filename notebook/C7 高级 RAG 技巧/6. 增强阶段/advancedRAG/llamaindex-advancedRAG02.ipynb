    "# 查询路由\n",
    "查询路由是LLM驱动的关键决策环节，它决定了在接收到用户查询后应采取的最佳行动——可能的行动包括生成摘要、对特定数据索引执行搜索或尝试多种不同的路由策略，并将它们的输出汇总成一个统一的答案。\n",
    "\n",
    "查询路由还负责选择最合适的数据存储位置来响应用户查询。这些数据存储位置可以是多种形式，如传统的向量存储、图形数据库、关系型数据库，或是分层次的索引系统。在处理包含多个文档的存储时，通常会利用两种不同的索引方式：摘要索引和文档块向量索引。\n",
    "\n",
    "定义查询路由器涉及设定它可以采取的行动选项。\n",
    "\n",
    "选择特定路由的过程是通过调用大型语言模型来实现的，其结果会按照预定义的格式返回，以便将查询定向到指定的索引。如果涉及到复杂的关联操作，这些查询还可能被发送到子链或其他智能体，如下文所述的多文档智能体方案所示。\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex和LangChain都提供了对查询路由的支持。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 智能体（Agent）\n",
    "在智能体技术的实现上，尤其是在基于大型语言模型（LLM）的智能体构建中，LLM在智能体的智能化中扮演着至关重要的角色。这些智能体能够通过整合LLM与规划、记忆以及其他关键技术模块，执行复杂的任务。在此框架中，LLM充当核心处理单元或“大脑”，负责管理和执行为特定任务或响应用户查询所需的一系列操作。\n",
    "智能体也是Langchain和LlamaIndex支持的一个概念，它从第一个LLM API发布之初就已存在。这个概念旨在为具备推理能力的LLM提供一套工具和任务。这些工具可能包括一些确定性的功能，如代码函数或外部API，甚至包括其他智能体——这种LLM之间的链接是LangChain名称的灵感来源。\n",
    "智能体本身是一个复杂的技术，下面将继续基于智能体的多文档检索案例，并在下文将要介绍的RAG系统中发挥作用。\n",
    "在LlamaIndex中，有一个OpenAIAgent类，它将这种高级逻辑与ChatEngine和QueryEngine类结合在一起，提供基于知识和上下文感知的聊天，以及在一个对话轮次中调用多个OpenAI函数的能力，这真正实现了智能代理行为。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 多文档智能体方案\n",
    "![mda](.\\mda.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "多文档智能体的方案是一个高度复杂的配置，它在每个文档上初始化一个Agent（OpenAIAgent），该智能体能进行文档摘要制作和传统问答机制的操作，还有一个顶层智能体，负责将查询分配到各个文档智能体，并综合形成最终的答案。\n",
    "\n",
    "每个文档智能体都配备了两个工具：向量存储索引和摘要索引，它根据路由查询来决定使用哪一个。对于顶层智能体来说，所有文档智能体都是其工具。\n",
    "\n",
    "该方案展示了一种高级RAG架构，其中每个智能体都进行多个决策的导航。这种方法的优势在于能够比较不同的解决方案或实体在不同文档及其摘要中的描述，以及传统的单个文档摘要和QA机制——这基本上涵盖了与文档集合聊天的最常见用例。\n",
    "\n",
    "这种复杂配置的缺点在于，由于需要在智能体内部的大语言模型之间进行多次往返迭代，其运行速度较慢。值得一提的是，LLM调用通常是RAG管道中最耗时的操作，而搜索则是为了速度而优化的设计。因此，对于大型的多文档存储，建议考虑对这种方案进行简化，以便实现扩展。\n",
    "\n",
    "下面将根据llamaindex官方示例进行讲解"
