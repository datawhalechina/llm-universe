With a population of 1,589,706 inhabitants as of 29 February 2024, it is the third-largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and thus the largest which does not constitute its own state, as well as the 11th-largest city in the European Union. The city's metropolitan region is home to about 6.2 million people and the third biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union.Straddling the banks of the river Isar north of the Alps, Munich is the seat of the Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria, while being the most densely populated municipality in Germany with 4,500 people per km2. Munich is the second-largest city in the Bavarian dialect area, after the Austrian capital of Vienna.\r\nThe city was first mentioned in 1158. Catholic Munich strongly resisted the Reformation and was a political point of divergence during the resulting Thirty Years' War, but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant Swedes. Once Bavaria was established as the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806, Munich became a major European centre of arts, architecture, culture and science. In 1918, during the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, the ruling House of Wittelsbach, which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and a short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic was declared. In the 1920s, Munich became home to several political factions, among them the Nazi Party. After the Nazis' rise to power, Munich was declared their \"Capital of the Movement\". The city was heavily bombed during World War II, but has restored most of its old town. After the end of postwar American occupation in 1949, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of Wirtschaftswunder. The city hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics.\r\nToday, Munich is a global centre of science, technology, finance, innovation, business, and tourism. Munich enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey, and being rated the world's most liveable city by the Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018. Munich is consistently ranked as one of the most expensive cities in Germany in terms of real estate prices and rental costs.In 2021, 28.8 percent of Munich's residents were foreigners, and another 17.7 percent were German citizens with a migration background from a foreign country. Munich's economy is based on high tech, automobiles, and the service sector, as well as IT, biotechnology, engineering, and electronics. It has one of the strongest economies of any German city and the lowest unemployment rate of all cities in Germany with more than one million inhabitants. The city houses many multinational companies, such as BMW, Siemens, Allianz SE and Munich Re. In addition, Munich is home to two research universities, and a multitude of scientific institutions. Munich's numerous architectural and cultural attractions, sports events, exhibitions and its annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest Volksfest, attract considerable tourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n== History ==\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Etymology ===\r\nMunich was a tiny 8th-century friar settlement, which was named zu den Munichen (\"to the monks\"). The Old High German Muniche served as basis for the modern German city name M\u00fcnchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Prehistory ===\r\nThe river Isar was a prehistoric trade route and in the Bronze Age Munich was among the largest raft ports in Europe. Bronze Age settlements up to four millennia old have been discovered. Evidence of Celt settlements from the Iron Age have been discovered in areas around Ramersdorf-Perlach.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Roman period ===\r\nThe ancient Roman road Via Julia, which connected Augsburg and Salzburg, crossed over the Isar south of Munich, at the towns of Baierbrunn and Gauting. A Roman settlement north-east of Munich was excavated in the neighborhood of Denning.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Post-Roman settlements ===\r\nStarting in the 6th century, the Baiuvarii populated the area around what is now modern Munich, such as in Johanneskirchen, Feldmoching, Bogenhausen and Pasing.

The Duke of Saxony and Bavaria Henry the Lion founded the town of Munich in his territory to control the salt trade, after having burned down the town of F\u00f6hring and its bridges over the Isar. Historians date this event at about 1158. The layout of Munich city, with five city gates and market place, resembled that of H\u00f6xter.Henry built a new toll bridge, customs house and a coin market closer to his home somewhat upstream at a settlement around the area of modern old town Munich. This new toll bridge most likely crossed the Isar where the Museuminsel and the modern Ludwigsbr\u00fccke is now located.Otto of Freising protested to his nephew, Emperor Frederick Barbarosa (d. 1190). However, on 14 June 1158, in Augsburg, the conflict was settled in favor of Duke Henry. The Augsburg Arbitration mentions the name of the location in dispute as forum apud Munichen. Although Bishop Otto had lost his bridge, the arbiters ordered Duke Henry to pay a third of his income to the Bishop in Freising as compensation.The 14. June 1158 is considered the official founding day of the city of Munich. Archaeological excavations at Marienhof Square (near Marienplatz) in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn (subway) in 2012 discovered shards of vessels from the 11th century, which prove again that the settlement of Munich must be older than the Augsburg Arbitration of 1158. The old St. Peter's Church near Marienplatz is also believed to predate the founding date of the town.In 1175, Munich received city status and fortification. In 1180, after Henry the Lion's fall from grace with Emperor Frederick Barbarosa, including his trial and exile, Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the Bishop of Freising. In 1240, Munich was transferred to Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255, when the Duchy of Bavaria was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria.\r\nDuke Louis IV, a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income.\r\nOn 13 February 1327, a large fire broke out in Munich that lasted two days and destroyed about a third of the town.In 1349, the Black Death ravaged Munich and Bavaria.In the 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of Gothic arts: the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest Gothic church \u2013 the Frauenkirche \u2013 now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Capital of reunited Bavaria ===\r\nWhen Bavaria was reunited in 1506 after a brief war against the Duchy of Landshut, Munich became its capital.

Albrecht V appointed the composer Orlando di Lasso as director of the court orchestra and tempted numerous Italian musicians to work at the Munich court, establishing Munich as a hub for late Renaissance music. During the rule of Duke William V Munich began to be called the \"German Rome\" and William V began presenting Emperor Charlemagne as ancestor of the Wittelsbach dynasty.Duke William V further cemented the Wittelsbach rule by commissioning the Jesuit Michaelskirche. He had the sermons of his Jesuit court preacher Jeremias Drexel translated from Latin into German and published them to a greater audience. William V was addressed with the epithet \"the Pious\" and like his contemporary Wittelsbach dukes promoted himself as \"father of the land\" (Landesvater), encouraged pilgrimages and Marian devotions. William V had the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus built in 1589. It would become the prototype for beer halls across Munich. After World War II the Residenze, the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, the Frauenkirche, and the Peterskirche were reconstructed to look exactly as they did before the Nazi Party seized power in 1933.\r\nThe Catholic League was founded in Munich in 1609. In 1623, during the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), Munich became an electoral residence when Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria was invested with the electoral dignity, but in 1632 the city was occupied by Gustav II Adolph of Sweden.In 1634 Swedish and Spanish troops advanced on Munich. Maximilian I published a plague ordinance to halt an epidemic escalation. The bubonic plague nevertheless ravaged Munich and the surrounding countryside in 1634 and 1635. During the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) troops again converged on Munich in 1647 and precautions were taken, so as to avoid another epidemic.Under the regency of the Bavarian electors, Munich was an important centre of Baroque life, but also had to suffer under Habsburg occupations in 1704 and 1742. When Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria died in 1745, the succession empowered the Palatinate branch within the House of Wittelsbach.In 1777 Bavarian lands were inherited to Charles Theodore. The new Duke was disliked by the citizens of Munich for his supposedly enlightened ideas. In 1785 Karl Theodor invited Count Rumford Benjamin Thompson to take up residency in Munich and implement stringent social reforms. The poor were forced to live in newly built workhouses. The Bavarian army was restructured, with common soldiers receiving better food and reassurances that they would be treated humanely by officers. Munich was the largest German city to lose fortification in the 1790s. In 1791 Karl Theodor and Count Rumford started to demolish Munich's fortifications. After 1793 Munich's citizens, including house servants, carpenters, butchers, merchants, and court officials, seized the opportunity, building new houses, stalls, and sheds outside the city walls.After making an alliance with Napoleonic France, the city became the capital of the new Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806 with Elector Maximillian Joseph becoming its first King. The state parliament (the Landtag) and the new archdiocese of Munich and Freising were also located in the city.The establishment of Bavarian state sovereignty profoundly affected Munich.

The king handed the brewing monopoly to Munich's wealthiest brewers, who in turn paid substantial taxs on their beer production. In 1807 the king abolished all ordinances that limited the number of apprentices and journeymen a brewery could employ. Munich's population had swelled and Munich brewers were now free to employ as many workers as they needed to meet the demand. In October 1810 a beer festival was held on the meadows just outside Munich to commemorate the wedding of the crown price and princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The parades in regional dress (Tracht) represented the diversity of the kingdom. The fields are now part of the Theresienwiese and the celebrations developed into Munich's annual Oktoberfest.The Bavarian state proceeded to take control over the beer market, by regulating all taxes on beer in 1806 and 1811. Brewers and the beer taverns (Wirtsh\u00e4user) were taxed, and the state also controlled the quality of beer while limiting the competition among breweries. In 1831 the king's government introduced a cost-of-living allowance on beer for lower-ranking civil servants and soldiers. Soldiers stationed in Munich were granted a daily allowance for beer in the early 1840s. By the 1850s beer had become essential staple food for Munich's working and lower classes. Since the Middle Ages beer had been regarded as nutritious liquid bread (flie\u00dfendes Brot) in Bavaria. But Munich suffered from poor water sanitation and as early as the 1700s beer came to be regarded as the fifth element. Beer was essential in maintaining public health in Munich and in the mid-1840s Munich police estimated that at least 40,000 residents relied primarily on beer for their nutrition.\r\nIn 1832 Peter von Hess painted the Greek War of Independence at the order of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Ludwig I had the K\u00f6nigsplatz built in neoclassicism as a matter of ideological choice. Leo von Klenze supervised the construction of a Propylaia between 1854 and 1862.During the early to mid-19th century, the old fortified city walls of Munich were largely demolished due to population expansion. The first Munich railway station was built in 1839, with a line going to Augsburg in the west. By 1849 a newer Munich Central Train Station (M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof) was completed, with a line going to Landshut and Regensburg in the north. In 1825 Ludwig I had ascended to the throne and commissioned leading architects such as Leo von Klenze to design a series of public museums in neoclassical style. The grand building projects of Ludwig I got Munich the endearment \"Isar-Athen\" and \"Monaco di Bavaria\". Between 1856 and 1861 the court gardener Carl von Effner landscaped the banks of river Isar and established the Maximilian Gardens. Since 1848 the M\u00fcnchner Neueste Nachrichten were published as a regional newspaper in Munich. In 1857 the construction of the Maximilianeum was started.By the time Ludwig II became king in 1864, he remained mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside, which is why he is known the world over as the 'fairytale king'. Ludwig II tried to lure Richard Wagner to Munich, but his plans for an opera house were declined by the city council.

Ludwig II tried to lure Richard Wagner to Munich, but his plans for an opera house were declined by the city council. Ludwig II nevertheless generated a windfall for Munich's craft and construction industries. In 1876 Munich hosted the first German Art and Industry Exhibition, which showcased the northern Neo-Renaissance fashion that came to be the German Empire's predominant style.

In 1901 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.The Prince Regent Luitpold's reign from 1886 till 1912 was marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich. At the dawn of the 20th century Munich was an epicenter for the Jugendstil movement, combining a liberal magazine culture with progressive industrial design and architecture. The German art movement took its name from the Munich magazine Die Jugend (The Youth). Prominent Munich Jugendstil artists include Hans Eduard von Berlepsch-Valendas, Otto Eckmann, Margarethe von Brauchitsch, August Endell, Hermann Obrist, Wilhelm von Debschitz, and Richard Riemerschmid. In 1905 two large department stores opened in Munich, the Kaufhaus Oberpollinger and the Warenhaus Hermann Tietz, both had been designed by the architect Max Littmann. In 1911 the expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter was established in Munich. Its founding members include Gabriele M\u00fcnter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== World War I to World War II ===\r\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on Munich.In 1916, the 'Bayerische Motoren Werke' (BMW) produced its first aircraft engine in Munich. The stock cooperation BMW AG was founded in 1918, with Camillo Castiglioni owning one third of the share capital. In 1922 BMW relocated its headquarters to a factory in Munich.After World War I, the city was at the centre of substantial political unrest. In November 1918, on the eve of the German revolution, Ludwig III of Bavaria and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. The November 1918 revolution ended the reign of the Wittelsbach in Bavaria. In Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler described his political activism in Munich after November 1918 as the \"Beginning of My Political Activity\". Hitler called the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic \"the rule of the Jews\". In 1919 Bavaria Film was founded and in the 1920s Munich offered film makers an alternative to Germany's largest film studio in Babelsberg.\r\nIn 1923 Gustav von Kahr was appointed Bavarian prime minister and immediately planned for the expulsion of all Jews that did not hold German citizenship. Chief of Police Ernst P\u00f6hner and Wilhelm Frick openly indulged in antisemitism, while Bavarian judges praised people on the political right as patriotic for their crimes and handed down mild sentences. In 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party (NSDAP).Munich was chosen as capital for the Free State of Bavaria and acquired increased responsibility for administering the city itself and the surrounding districts. Offices needed to be built for bureaucracy, so a 12-story office building was erected in the southern part of the historic city centre in the late 1920s.Munich again became important to the Nazis when they took power in Germany in 1933.

The party created its first concentration camp at Dachau, 16 km (9.9 mi) north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the Hauptstadt der Bewegung (\"Capital of the Movement\").The NSDAP headquarters and the documentation apparatus for controlling all aspects of life were located in Munich. Nazi organizations, such as the National Socialist Women's League and the Gestapo, had their offices along Brienner Stra\u00dfe and around the K\u00f6nigsplatz. The party acquired 68 buildings in the area and many F\u00fchrerbauten (\"F\u00fchrer buildings\") were built to reflect a new aesthetic of power. Construction work for the F\u00fchrerbau and the party headquarters (known as the Brown House) started in September 1933. The Haus der Kunst (House of German Art) was the first building to be commissioned by Hitler. The architect Paul Troost was asked to start work shortly after the Nazis had seized power because \"the most German of all German cities\" was left with no exhibition building when in 1931 the Glass Palace was destroyed in an arson. The Red Terror that supposedly preceded Nazi control in Munich, was detailed in Nazi publications, seminal accounts are that of Rudolf Schricker Rotmord \u00fcber M\u00fcnchen published in 1934, and Die Blutchronik des Marxismus in Deutschland by Adolf Ehrt and Hans Roden.In 1930 Feinkost K\u00e4fer was founded in Munich, the K\u00e4fer catering business is now a world leading party service.The city was the site where the 1938 Munich Agreement signed between the United Kingdom and the Third French Republic with Nazi Germany as part of the Franco-British policy of appeasement. The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain assented to the German annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland in the hopes of satisfying Hitler's territorial expansion.The Munich-Riem Airport was completed in October 1939.On 8 November 1939, shortly after the Second World War had begun, Georg Elser planted a bomb in the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller in Munich in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, who held a political party speech. Hitler, however, had left the building minutes before the bomb went off. By mid 1942 the majority of Jews living in Munich and the suburbs had been deported.\r\nDuring the war, Munich was the location of multiple forced labour camps, including two Polenlager camps for Polish youth, and 40 subcamps of the Dachau concentration camp, in which men and women of various nationalities were held. With up to 17,000 prisoners in 1945, the largest subcamp of Dachau was the Munich-Allach concentration camp.\r\nMunich was the base of the White Rose, a student resistance movement. The group had distributed leaflets in several cities and following the 1943 Battle of Stalingrad members of the group stenciled slogans such as \"Down with Hitler\" and \"Hitler the Mass Murderer\" on public buildings in Munich. The core members were arrested and executed after Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans Scholl were caught distributing leaflets on Munich University campus calling upon the youth to rise against Hitler.The city was heavily damaged by the bombing of Munich in World War II, with 71 air raids over five years. US troops liberated Munich on 30 April 1945.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Postwar ===\r\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Germany and Japan were subject to US Military occupation.

In Munich, the Bayerischer Rundfunk began its first television broadcast in 1954.The Free State of Bavaria used the arms industry as kernel for its high tech development policy. Since 1963, Munich has been hosting the Munich Security Conference, held annually in the Hotel Bayerischer Hof. Munich also became known on the political level due to the strong influence of Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss from the 1960s to the 1980s. The Munich Airport, which commenced operations in 1992, was named in his honor.In the early 1960s Dieter Kunzelmann was expelled from the Situationist International and founded an influential group called Subversive Aktion in Munich. Kunzelmann was also active in West Berlin, and became known for using situationist avant-garde as a cover for political violence.\r\nMunich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics. After winning the bid in 1966 the Mayor of Munich Hans-Jochen Vogel accelerated the construction of the U-Bahn subway and the S-Bahn metropolitan commuter railway. In May 1967 the construction work began for a new U-Bahn line connecting the city with the Olympic Park. The Olympic Park subway station was built near the BMW Headquarters and the line was completed May 1972, three months before the opening of the 1972 Summer Olympics. Shortly before the opening ceremony, Munich also inaugurated a sizable pedestrian priority zone between Karlsplatz and Marienplatz. In 1970 the Munich city council released funds so that the iconic gothic facade and Glockenspiel of the New City Hall (Neues Rathaus) could be restored.During 1972 Summer Olympics 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the Munich massacre, when gunmen from the Palestinian \"Black September\" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team.The most deadly militant attack the Federal Republic of Germany has ever witnessed, was the Oktoberfest bombing. The attack was eventually blamed on militant Neo-Nazism.\r\nMunich and its urban sprawl emerged as leading German high tech region during the 1980s and 1990s. The urban economy of Munich became characterized by a dynamic labour market, low unemployment, a growing service economy and high per capita income. Munich is home of the famous Nockherberg Strong Beer Festival during the Lenten fasting period (usually in March). Its origins go back to the 17th/18th century, but has become popular when the festivities were first televised in the 1980s. The fest includes comical speeches and a mini-musical in which numerous German politicians are parodied by look-alike actors.In 2007 the ecological restoration of the river Isar in the urban area of Munich was awarded the Water Development Prize by the German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste (known as DWA in German). The renaturation of the Isar allows for the near natural development of the river bed and is part of Munich's flood protection. About 20 percent of buildings in Munich now have a green roof, the Munich city council has been encouraging better stormwater management since the 1990s with regulations and subsidies.On the fifth anniversary of the 2011 Norway attacks an active shooter perpetrated a hate crime. The 2016 Munich shooting targeted people of Turkish and Arab descent.Munich was one of the host cities for UEFA Euro 2020, which was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, and is planned to be a host city for UEFA Euro 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Geography ==\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Topography ===\r\nMunich lies on the elevated plains of Upper Bavaria, about 50 km (31 mi) north of the northern edge of the Alps, at an altitude of about 520 m (1,706 ft) ASL.

The local rivers are the Isar and the W\u00fcrm. Munich is situated in the Northern Alpine Foreland. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by the folding processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered with morainic hills. Between these are fields of fluvio-glacial out-wash, such as around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the north of Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Climate ===\r\nMunich is located in close proximity of the Alps. Munich has an oceanic climate (Cfb) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Annual variation in temperature can be significant, as there are no substantial bodies of water nearby. The winter in Munich is generally cold and overcast, while some Munich winters can be marked by significant snow. January is the coldest month. While winter averages remain only moderately cold, and relatively mild for an elevated inland location of its latitude, inversion from the nearby Alps cause cold air to sink and result temperatures below \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F). In Munich the summer is usually pleasantly warm, with daytime temperatures averaging 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F)\r\nMunich is subject to active convective seasons and on occasion damaging events. The Alpine thunderstorm system moves along the mountain range, or detaches, heading east-north-east over the foothills of the Alps.At Munich's official weather stations, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are 37.5 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and \u221231.6 \u00b0C (\u221224.9 \u00b0F), on 12 February 1929 in the Botanic Garden of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Climate change ====\r\nIn Munich, the general trend of global warming with a rise of medium yearly temperatures of about 1 \u00b0C in Germany over the last 120 years can be observed as well. In November 2016 the city council concluded officially that a further rise in medium temperature, a higher number of heat extremes, a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20 \u00b0C (tropical nights), a change in precipitation patterns, as well as a rise in the number of local instances of heavy rain, is to be expected as part of the ongoing climate change. The city administration decided to support a joint study from its own Referat f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Umwelt (department for health and environmental issues) and the German Meteorological Service that will gather data on local weather. The data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection in Munich. With the help of those programs issues regarding spatial planning and settlement density, the development of buildings and green spaces as well as plans for functioning ventilation in a cityscape can be monitored and managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Demographics ==\r\n\r\nFrom only 24,000 inhabitants in 1700, the city population doubled about every 30 years. It was 100,000 in 1852, 250,000 in 1883 and 500,000 in 1901. Since then, Munich has become Germany's third-largest city. In 1933, 840,901 inhabitants were counted, and in 1957 over 1 million. Munich has reached 1.5 million in 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Immigration ===\r\nIn July 2017, Munich had 1.42 million inhabitants; 421,832 foreign nationals resided in the city as of 31 December 2017 with 50.7% of these residents being citizens of EU member states, and 25.2% citizens in European states not in the EU (including Russia and Turkey).", "start_char_idx": 24971, "end_char_idx": 29257, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e36294e6-7882-4671-8daf-528e1c401c75": {"__data__": {"id_": "e36294e6-7882-4671-8daf-528e1c401c75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e370cd1-dfe9-4664-92c4-649a4c97c28f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "hash": "9bef994fe3d9a5283e8945c2f37c7a17857feb91e74d018055b45797b0268325", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4444dad5-26f3-4f4b-a3bf-670eb1b22c2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "hash": "32295b1099aabde184320e25058f2b11a49cc03e94109abf6cb69b9e60673576", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "773ee539-89d0-4bc1-ad74-a4a0ece892e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "24e0271565fb74141eabfd9d9ec739ff8a0312c213b73a26d7447f73255f2efe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Demographics ==\r\n\r\nFrom only 24,000 inhabitants in 1700, the city population doubled about every 30 years.

Along with the Turks, the Croats are one of the two largest foreign minorities in the city, which is why some Croats refer to Munich as their \"second capital.\" The largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (39,204), Croats (33,177), Italians (27,340), Greeks (27,117), Poles (27,945), Austrians (21,944), and Romanians (18,085).\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Religion ===\r\nAbout 45% of Munich's residents are not affiliated with any religious group; this ratio represents the fastest growing segment of the population. As in the rest of Germany, the Catholic and Protestant churches have experienced a continuous decline in membership. As of 31 December 2017, 31.8% of the city's inhabitants were Catholic, 11.4% Protestant, 0.3% Jewish, and 3.6% were members of an Orthodox Church (Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox). About 1% adhere to other Christian denominations. There is also a small Old Catholic parish and an English-speaking parish of the Episcopal Church in the city. According to Munich Statistical Office, in 2013 about 8.6% of Munich's population was Muslim.\r\nMunich has the largest Uyghur population with about 800 (whole Germany about 1,600) people with Uyghur diaspora. Many of them fled to Munich due to the Chinese government and are exiled in Munich. Munich is also home to World Uyghur Congress, which is an international organisation of exiled Uyghurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Government and politics ==\r\nAs the capital of Bavaria, Munich is an important political centre for both the state and country as a whole. It is the seat of the Landtag of Bavaria, the State Chancellery, and all state departments. Several national and international authorities are located in Munich, including the Federal Finance Court of Germany, the German Patent Office and the European Patent Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Mayor ===\r\nThe current mayor of Munich is Dieter Reiter, he is Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He was elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2020. Bavaria has been dominated by the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) on a federal, state, and local level since the establishment of the Federal Republic in 1949.

The number of districts is about 50, and if smaller units are counted as well, there are about 90 to 100 (see map). The three largest districts are Schwabing in the north (about 110,000 inhabitants), Sendling in the southwest (about 100,000 inhabitants), and Giesing in the south (about 80,000 inhabitants).\r\n\r\n\r\n== Architecture ==\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Old Town ===\r\nAt the centre of the old town is the Marienplatz with the Old Town Hall and the New Town Hall. Its tower contains the Rathaus-Glockenspiel. The Peterskirche is the oldest church of the inner city. Nearby St. Peter the Gothic hall-church Heiliggeistkirche was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the Viktualienmarkt. Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification survive, these are the Isartor, the Sendlinger Tor, and the Karlstor. The Karlstor leads up to the Stachus, a square dominated by the Justizpalast (Palace of Justice).\r\nThe Frauenkirche serves as the cathedral for the Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. The nearby Michaelskirche is the largest renaissance church north of the Alps, while the Theatinerkirche is a basilica in Italianate high baroque, which had a major influence on southern German baroque architecture. Its dome dominates the Odeonsplatz.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Palaces and castles ===\r\nSchloss Nymphenburg (Nymphenburg Palace, construction started 1664) is a museum open to the public for tours.The smaller Schloss F\u00fcrstenried (F\u00fcrstenried Palace, construction 1715\u20131717) is used by the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising as a conference location.Schloss Blutenburg (Blutenburg Castle) opened as a children's library in 2024, but visitors may tour the late-Gothic Blutenburg Castle Church built on the same grounds.The large Munich Residenz complex on the edge of Munich's Old Town now ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Within the Residenz is the splendid Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre and next door is the National Theatre Munich. Among the mansions that still exist in Munich are the Palais Porcia, the Palais Preysing, the Palais Holnstein and the Prinz-Carl-Palais. All mansions are situated close to the Residenz, so is the Alter Hof, the first residence of the House of Wittelsbach.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Modernist architecture ===\r\nDespite Munich being the breeding ground for German Jugendstil, starting with the architect Martin D\u00fclfer, Munich Jugendstil style was quickly submerged in historic trash.

While the modernist architect Theodor Fischer was based in Munich, his influence on Munich underwhelmed. Prior to 1914 the city of Munich was under-industrialized. During the Weimar Republic, the Munich establishment was hostile to modernism. The TUM professor German Bestelmeyer favored a conservative style, and Jacobus Oud was rejected for the post of city building chief. Modernist exceptions include a series of post offices by Robert Vorhoelzer built in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Examples of avant-garde temporary constructions include the Wohnmaschine (Housing Machine) by Robert Vorhoelzer, as well as the Flachdachhaus (Flat Roof House) by Fritz Norkauer. Paul Schultze-Naumburg, and the Kampfbund enjoyed particular popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== High rise buildings ===\r\nSeveral high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the HVB Tower, the Arabella High-Rise Building, the Highlight Towers, Uptown Munich, M\u00fcnchner Tor and the BMW Headquarters next to the Olympic Park. Further high-rise buildings are located in the Werksviertel in Berg am Laim.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Long-term residential development ===\r\nMunich is subject to a long-term residential development plan that is established by the city administration of Munich. The LaSie (\"Langfristige Siedlungsentwicklung\") was passed in 2011 in response to the acute housing crisis. LaSie is aligned with the strategic development plan passed for Munich in 1998 (\"Perspektive M\u00fcnchen\"). LaSie defines three priorities for the construction of residential housing in Munich. Existing housing estates, post-war low-density developments, and the suburban area are subject to densification (\"Nachverdichtung\"). Non-residential industrial areas are subject to conservation and will be turned into residential and mixed-use areas. On greenfield sites in the Munich periphery medium and large-scale housing estates are to be built so as to extend Munich's urban center.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Parks ==\r\nFriedrich Ludwig von Sckell became famous for designing the Englischer Garten between 1789 and 1807. Besides planning the first public garden in Europe, Sckell also redesigned Baroque gardens as landscape gardens, including the parks of Nymphenburg Palace and the Botanischer Garten M\u00fcnchen-Nymphenburg.Other large green spaces are the Olympiapark, the Westpark and the Ostpark. The city's oldest park is the Hofgarten, near the Residenz, dating back to the 16th century. The site of the largest beer garden in town, the former royal Hirschgarten, was founded in 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Sports ==\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Football ===\r\n\r\nMunich is home to several professional Association football teams including the FC Bayern Munich. Other notable clubs include 1860 Munich, who currently play in the 3. Liga, and former Bundesliga club SpVgg Unterhaching, who currently play in the 3. Liga.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Basketball ===\r\nFC Bayern Munich Basketball is currently playing in the Beko Basket Bundesliga. The city hosted the final stages of the FIBA EuroBasket 1993, where the German national basketball team won the gold medal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Ice hockey ===\r\nThe city's ice hockey club is EHC Red Bull M\u00fcnchen who play in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. The team has won four DEL Championships, in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Olympics ===\r\nMunich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics; the Munich massacre took place in the Olympic village. It was one of the host cities for the 2006 Football World Cup, which was not held in Munich's Olympic Stadium, but in a new football specific stadium, the Allianz Arena.

Popular indoor swimming pools include the Olympia Schwimmhalle of the 1972 Summer Olympics, the wave pool Cosimawellenbad, as well as the M\u00fcllersches Volksbad which was built in 1901. Further, swimming within Munich's city limits is also possible in several artificial lakes such as for example the Riemer See or the Langwieder lake district.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== River surfing ===\r\nRiver surfing is a popular sport in Munich. The Flosskanal wave in the south of Munich is less challenging. A well visited surfing spot for experienced surfers is the Eisbach standing wave, where the annual Munich Surf Open is celebrated on the last Saturday of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Culture ==\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Language ===\r\n\r\nGerman is spoken and understood in and around Munich. While the German language has many dialects, so-called \"Standard German\" or \"High German\" is learned in schools and spoken among Germans, Austrians and in some parts of Switzerland. A speaker of a Low German dialect in Hamburg may find it difficult to understand the dialect of a Bavarian mountaineer. The Bavarian dialects are recognized as regional language and continues to be spoken alongside Standard German.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Museums ===\r\nThe gothic Morris dancers of Erasmus Grasser are exhibited in the Munich City Museum in the old gothic arsenal building in the inner city.\r\nIn 1903 Oskar von Miller assembled a group of engineers and industrialists, who chartered the Deutsches Museum. The Museum was built with the financial support of the German business and imperial nobility community, as well as the blessing of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. The Deutsches Museum had its grand opening in 1925, but has undergone a reinvention recently. The Deutsches Museum now operates three locations. The original site in central Munich continues to expand its exhibits.\r\nThe city has several important art galleries, most of which can be found in the Kunstareal. The Lenbachhaus displays works of the movement Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a Munich-based modernist art.\r\nStarting in 1970s, German municipalities started to respond to cultural tourism and invested in public museums. The Neue Pinakothek, like other German museums, was wholly reconstructed from 1974 until 1981. The Pinakothek der Moderne lets the public see an eclectic mix of contemporary art and the principle attention of the permanent collection is Classical Moderns. But the displays are enhanced continuously with spectacular gifts from private collections.City guides published in the early 1860s directed tourists to Munich's architecture and art collections, which at the time were unique in Germany and are a legacy mainly of Ludwig I of Bavaria, with contributions from Maximilian II of Bavaria. The Alte Pinakothek contains works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. Major displays include Albrecht D\u00fcrer's Self-Portrait (1500), his Four Apostles, Raphael's paintings The Canigiani Holy Family and Madonna Tempi as well as Peter Paul Rubens large Judgment Day.   \r\n\r\nAn extensive collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the Glyptothek and the Staatliche Antikensammlungen (the State Antiquities Collections). Works on display include the Medusa Rondanini, the Barberini Faun and figures from the Temple of Aphaea on Aegina for the Glyptothek.", "start_char_idx": 38440, "end_char_idx": 42916, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d4fc8f2-0329-4a01-9c76-6aeabbcc87c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d4fc8f2-0329-4a01-9c76-6aeabbcc87c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e370cd1-dfe9-4664-92c4-649a4c97c28f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "hash": "9bef994fe3d9a5283e8945c2f37c7a17857feb91e74d018055b45797b0268325", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb3adc69-05a0-459e-b387-c62ae22c8d6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "hash": "634891fb6efd9a1f743dc049027d46abdd4e6b042dc2e345ba7c3aea6391b517", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "869205e9-dd50-4715-9b79-c223b50c1bbc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0e3d445c3e5f96060bc147d235349d6a66fcfa95b9d801f4ab3b0dc15aff7e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Alte Pinakothek contains works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries.

Another interesting museum is the Staatliche Sammlung f\u00fcr \u00c4gyptische Kunst (the State Collection of Egyptian Art).Several public collections of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich are still housed in the Kunstareal. The expanded state collections are housed in the Pal\u00e4ontologisches Museum M\u00fcnchen, and the Zoologische Staatssammlung M\u00fcnchen. After the first German art exhibition in the Glaspalast for an international audience in 1869, Munich emerged as a focal point for the arts. Men of distinction from around the world visited the Academy of Fine Arts under the directorship of Karl von Piloty and later Wilhelm von Kaulbach.The Museum Five Continents is the second largest collection in Germany of artefacts and objects from outside Europe, while the Bavarian National Museum and the adjoining Bavarian State Archaeological Collection display regional art and cultural history. The Schackgalerie is an important gallery of German 19th-century paintings.The memorial museum of the former Dachau concentration camp is just outside the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Music ===\r\nMunich is a major international musical centre and has played host to many prominent composers including Orlande de Lassus, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Carl Maria von Weber, Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Max Reger and Carl Orff. Some of classical music's best-known compositions have been created in and around Munich by composers born in the area, for example, Richard Strauss's tone poem Also sprach Zarathustra or Carl Orff's Carmina Burana.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Opera ===\r\nRichard Wagner was a supporter of William I, German Emperor, but Wagner only found a generous patron in Ludwig II of Bavaria. 1870 til 1871 Wagner premiered Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg) in Munich, a popular success for Wagner and King Ludwig II. Wagner premiered at the Hoftheater, now the National Theatre Munich, with Angelo Quaglio the Younger designing the premiere production.The National Theatre Munich is now the home of the Bavarian State Opera and the Bavarian State Orchestra. Next door, the modern Residenz Theatre was erected in the building that also houses the Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre. The Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz is a state theater while another opera house, the Prinzregententheater, has become the home of the Bavarian Theater Academy and the Munich Chamber Orchestra.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Orchestra ===\r\nThe modern Gasteig centre houses the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The third orchestra in Munich with international importance is the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. Its primary concert venue is the Herkulessaal in the former city royal residence, the Munich Residenz.

A stage for shows, big events and musicals is the Deutsche Theater. It is Germany's largest theatre for guest performances.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Pop and electronica ===\r\nMunich was the centre of Krautrock in southern Germany, with many important bands such as Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II, Embryo or Popol Vuh hailing from the city. In the 1970s, the Musicland Studios developed into one of the most prominent recording studios in the world, with bands such as the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Queen recording albums there. Munich also played a significant role in the development of electronic music, with genre pioneer Giorgio Moroder, who invented synth disco and electronic dance music, and Donna Summer, one of disco music's most important performers, both living and working in the city.", "start_char_idx": 42344, "end_char_idx": 46710, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "869205e9-dd50-4715-9b79-c223b50c1bbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "869205e9-dd50-4715-9b79-c223b50c1bbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e370cd1-dfe9-4664-92c4-649a4c97c28f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "hash": "9bef994fe3d9a5283e8945c2f37c7a17857feb91e74d018055b45797b0268325", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d4fc8f2-0329-4a01-9c76-6aeabbcc87c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "hash": "de5fa071fb277052854be206b7d32f50698b6f77b29e0fc29b0f8addedf46324", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23f3f4d1-fffe-4724-8aab-1284f2f14f22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cedca1cbb073b5184e7ebfc8575356f732b79bb5c655261be282c38afd3fdba1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A stage for shows, big events and musicals is the Deutsche Theater.

In the late 1990s, Electroclash was substantially co-invented if not even invented in Munich, when DJ Hell introduced and assembled international pioneers of this musical genre through his International DeeJay Gigolo Records label here.Other notable musicians and bands from Munich include Konstantin Wecker, Willy Astor, Spider Murphy Gang, M\u00fcnchener Freiheit, Lou Bega, Megaherz, FSK, Colour Haze and Sportfreunde Stiller.Munich hosted several Love Parades and Mayday Party rave events throughout the 1990s. Munich continues to rave, the local youth scenes are active.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Theatre ===\r\nThe Munich Kammerspiele is one of the most important German-language theaters. Since Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's premieres in 1775 many important writers have staged their plays in Munich, they include Christian Friedrich Hebbel, Henrik Ibsen, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Schwabing ===\r\nAt the turn of the 20th century Schwabing was a preeminent cultural metropolis. Schwabing was an epicenter for both literature and the fine arts, with numerous German and non-German artists living there.Vladimir Lenin authored What Is to Be Done? while living in Schwabing. Central to Schwabing's bohemian scene were K\u00fcnstlerlokale (Artist's Caf\u00e9s) like Caf\u00e9 Stefanie or Kabarett Simpl, whose liberal ways differed fundamentally from Munich's more traditional localities. The Simpl, which survives to this day, was named after Munich's anti-authoritarian satirical magazine Simplicissimus, founded in 1896 by Albert Langen and Thomas Theodor Heine, which quickly became an important organ of the Schwabinger Boh\u00e8me. Its caricatures and biting satirical attacks on Wilhelmine German society were the result of countless of collaborative efforts by many of the best visual artists and writers from Munich and elsewhere.In 1971 Eckart Witzigmann teamed up with a Munich building contractor to finance and open the Tantris restaurant in Schwabing. Witzigmann is credited for starting the German K\u00fcchenwunder (kitchen wonder).\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Biedermeier ===\r\nThe Biedermeier era was named after a character that regularly appeared in the satire magazine M\u00fcnchner Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter (Loose Munich Pages), which was published by Adolf Kussmaul and Ludwig Eichrodt in Munich between 1855 and 1857. Biedermeier was a synonym for arts, furniture, and the lifestyle of the nonheroic middle class. The Biedermeier era painters Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller, Moritz von Schwind, and Carl Spitzweg are shown in the Neue Pinakothek.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Prinzregentenzeit ===\r\nCelebrity literary figures worked in Munich especially during the final decades of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the so-called Prinzregentenzeit (literally prince regent's time) under the reign of Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. This includes Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann, Paul Johann Ludwig von Heyse, Rainer Maria Rilke, Ludwig Thoma, Fanny zu Reventlow, Oskar Panizza, Gustav Meyrink, Max Halbe, Erich M\u00fchsam and Frank Wedekind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Weimar Republic ===\r\nThe period immediately before World War I saw continued economic and cultural prominence for the city.

Thomas Mann wrote in his novella Gladius Dei about this period: \"M\u00fcnchen leuchtete\" (literally \"Munich shone\"). Munich remained a centre of cultural life during the Weimar Republic, with figures such as Lion Feuchtwanger, Bertolt Brecht, Peter Paul Althaus, Stefan George, Ricarda Huch, Joachim Ringelnatz, Oskar Maria Graf, Annette Kolb, Ernst Toller, Hugo Ball, and Klaus Mann adding to the already established big names.Karl Valentin, the cabaret performer and comedian, is to this day remembered and beloved as a cultural icon of his hometown. Between 1910 and 1940, he wrote and performed in many absurdist sketches and short films that were highly influential, earning him the nickname of \"Charlie Chaplin of Germany\".Liesl Karlstadt, before working together with Valentin, cross-dressed and performed cabaret with yodeling on stage and in Munich's Cafe-Theatres. The cabaret scene was crushed when the Nazis seized power in 1933 and Karlstadt was saved from Nazi sterilization by a doctor. Contemporary Munich cabaret still reverences 1920s cabaret, the Munich alternative rock band F.S.K. absorbs yodels.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Post-war literature ===\r\nAfter World War II, Munich soon again became a focal point of the German literary scene and remains so to this day, with writers as diverse as Wolfgang Koeppen, Erich K\u00e4stner, Eugen Roth, Alfred Andersch, Elfriede Jelinek, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Michael Ende, Franz Xaver Kroetz, Gerhard Polt and Patrick S\u00fcskind calling the city their home.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Fine arts ===\r\nFrom the Gothic to the Baroque era, the fine arts were represented in Munich by artists like Erasmus Grasser, Jan Polack, Johann Baptist Straub, Ignaz G\u00fcnther, Hans Krumpper, Ludwig von Schwanthaler, Cosmas Damian Asam, Egid Quirin Asam, Johann Baptist Zimmermann, Johann Michael Fischer and Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s. Munich had already become an important place for painters like Carl Rottmann, Lovis Corinth, Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Carl Spitzweg, Franz von Lenbach, Franz Stuck, Karl Piloty and Wilhelm Leibl.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Cinema ===\r\nMunich was (and in some cases, still is) home to many of the most important authors of the New German Cinema movement, including Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Edgar Reitz and Herbert Achternbusch. In 1971, the Filmverlag der Autoren was founded, cementing the city's role in the movement's history. Munich served as the location for many of Fassbinder's films, among them Ali: Fear Eats the Soul. The Hotel Deutsche Eiche near G\u00e4rtnerplatz was somewhat like a centre of operations for Fassbinder and his \"clan\" of actors. New German Cinema is considered by far the most important artistic movement in German cinema history since the era of German Expressionism in the 1920s.\r\nIn 1919, the Bavaria Film Studios were founded, which developed into one of Europe's largest film studios. Directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, Orson Welles, John Huston, Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Claude Chabrol, Fritz Umgelter, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Wolfgang Petersen and Wim Wenders made films there. Among the internationally well-known films produced at the studios are The Pleasure Garden (1925) by Alfred Hitchcock, The Great Escape (1963) by John Sturges, Paths of Glory (1957) by Stanley Kubrick, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) by Mel Stuart and both Das Boot (1981) and The Neverending Story (1984) by Wolfgang Petersen.", "start_char_idx": 49211, "end_char_idx": 53193, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e67fa9a-ca16-4ced-8bdc-fb1fbb05b220": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e67fa9a-ca16-4ced-8bdc-fb1fbb05b220", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3e370cd1-dfe9-4664-92c4-649a4c97c28f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "hash": "9bef994fe3d9a5283e8945c2f37c7a17857feb91e74d018055b45797b0268325", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "23f3f4d1-fffe-4724-8aab-1284f2f14f22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data\\Munich.txt", "file_name": "Munich.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76581, "creation_date": "2024-04-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-04"}, "hash": "d77388459e4eb0b5f2e48ee27aed8f2c882de4bb8b0397ad6b7ec7ec26dc46f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "de64f4ed-0ab5-4654-a5a0-028b9efea2bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8cbbac0be50825d46c98471d2fb9383474388c254f540b9b199c0765a2cebfe5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In 1919, the Bavaria Film Studios were founded, which developed into one of Europe's largest film studios.

The dance was supposed to be held every seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Starkbierfest ====\r\nMarch and April, for three weeks during Lent, celebrating Munich's \"strong beer\". Starkbier was created in 1651 by the local Paulinerkirche, Leipzig monks who drank this 'Fl\u00fcssiges Brot', or 'liquid bread'.

Helles, a pale lager with a translucent gold color, is the most popular contemporary Munich beer. Helles has largely replaced Munich's dark beer, known as Dunkel, which gets its color from roasted malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, with a high alcohol content of 6%\u20139%. It is dark amber in color and has a heavy malty taste. The beer served at Oktoberfest is a special type of beer with a higher alcohol content.\r\nWirtsh\u00e4user are traditional Bavarian pubs, many of which also have small outside areas. Bierg\u00e4rten (beer gardens) are a popular fixture in Munich's gastronomic landscape. They are central to the city's culture, and are an overt melting pot for members of all walks of life, regardless of social class. There are many smaller beer gardens, but some beer gardens have thousands of seats. Large beer gardens can be found in the Englischer Garten, on the Nockherberg, and in the Hirschgarten.\r\nThere are six main breweries in Munich are Augustiner-Br\u00e4u, Hacker-Pschorr Brewery, Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u, Paulaner, and Spaten-Franziskaner-Br\u00e4u. Smaller breweries are becoming more prevalent in Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Circus ===\r\nThe Circus Krone based in Munich is one of the largest circuses in Europe. It was the first and still is one of only a few in Western Europe to also occupy a building of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Nightlife ===\r\nNightlife in Munich is located mostly in the boroughs Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, Maxvorstadt, Au-Haidhausen, Berg am Laim and Sendling. Between Sendlinger Tor and Maximiliansplatz, on the edge of the central Altstadt-Lehel district, there is also the so-called Feierbanane (party banana), a roughly banana-shaped unofficial party zone spanning 1.3 km (0.8 mi) along Sonnenstra\u00dfe, characterized by a high concentration of clubs, bars and restaurants, which became the center of Munich's nightlife in the mid-2000s.\r\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Schwabing was considered a center of nightlife in Germany, with internationally known clubs such as Big Apple, PN hit-house, Domicile, Hot Club, Piper Club, Tiffany, Germany's first large-scale discotheque Blow Up and the underwater nightclub Yellow Submarine, and Munich has been called \"New York's big disco sister\" in this context. Bars in the Schwabing district of this era include, among many others, Schwabinger 7 and Schwabinger Podium. Since the 1980s, however, Schwabing has lost much of its nightlife activity due to gentrification and the resulting high rents, and the formerly wild artists' and students' quarter developed into one of the city's most coveted and expensive residential districts, attracting affluent citizens with little interest in partying.Since the 1960s, the Rosa Viertel (pink quarter) developed in the Glockenbachviertel and around G\u00e4rtnerplatz, which in the 1980s made Munich \"one of the four gayest metropolises in the world\" along with San Francisco, New York City and Amsterdam. In particular, the area around M\u00fcllerstra\u00dfe and Hans-Sachs-Stra\u00dfe was characterized by numerous gay bars and nightclubs. One of them was the travesty nightclub Old Mrs. Henderson, where Freddie Mercury, who lived in Munich from 1979 to 1985, filmed the music video for the song Living on My Own at his 39th birthday party.Since the mid-1990s, the Kunstpark Ost and its successor Kultfabrik, a former industrial complex that was converted to a large party area near M\u00fcnchen Ostbahnhof in Berg am Laim, hosted more than 30 clubs and was especially popular among younger people from the metropolitan area surrounding Munich and tourists. The Kultfabrik was closed at the end of the year 2015 to convert the area into a residential and office area. Apart from the Kultfarbik and the smaller Optimolwerke, there is a wide variety of establishments in the urban parts of nearby Haidhausen.

Establishments open and close every year, and due to gentrification and the overheated housing market many survive only a few years, while others last longer. Beyond the already mentioned venues of the 1960s and 1970s, nightclubs with international recognition in recent history included Tanzlokal Gr\u00f6\u00dfenwahn, The Atomic Caf\u00e9 and the techno clubs Babalu Club, Ultraschall, KW \u2013 Das Heizkraftwerk, Natraj Temple, MMA Club (Mixed Munich Arts), Die Registratur and Bob Beaman.

In 2015, the transport modal share in Munich was 38 percent public transport, 25 percent car, 23 percent walking, and 15 percent bicycle. Its public transport system delivered 566 million passenger trips that year.Munich is the hub of a developed regional transportation system, including the second-largest airport in Germany and the Berlin\u2013Munich high-speed railway, which connects Munich to the German capital city with a journey time of about 4 hours. Flixmobility which offers intercity coach service is headquartered in Munich.\r\nThe trade fair Transport Logistic is held every two years at the Neue Messe M\u00fcnchen (Messe M\u00fcnchen International).\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Public transport ===\r\nFor its urban population of 2.6 million people, Munich and its closest suburbs have a comprehensive network of public transport incorporating the Munich U-Bahn, the Munich S-Bahn, trams and buses. The system is supervised by the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (M\u00fcnchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund). The Munich tramway is the oldest existing public transportation system in the city, which has been in operation since 1876. Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines. The average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work with public transit in Munich on a weekday is 56 min.The extensive network of subway and tram lines assists and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre. The 700m-long Kaufinger Stra\u00dfe, which starts near the Main train station, forms a pedestrian east\u2013west spine that traverses almost the entire centre. Major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike. These attributes result from applying the principle of filtered permeability. Pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire Munich city centre, go through public squares and open spaces for enjoyment. Munich city centre was subject to urban planning and has a comprehensive model for laying out neighborhoods and districts according to grid plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Cycling ===\r\n\r\nCycling has a strong presence in the city and is recognized as a good alternative. The growing number of bicycle lanes are widely used throughout the year. Cycle paths can be found alongside the majority of sidewalks and streets, although the newer or renovated ones are much easier to tell apart from pavements than older ones. A modern bike hire system is available within the area bounded by the Mittlerer Ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Cultural history trails and bicycle routes ===\r\nSince 2001, historically interesting places in Munich can be explored via the List of cultural history trails in Munich (KulturGeschichtsPfade). Sign-posted cycle routes are the Outer \u00c4u\u00dfere Radlring (outer cycle route) and the RadlRing M\u00fcnchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Munich Central Train Station ===\r\n\r\nM\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof is the central railway station located in the city centre and is the long-distance station in Munich.Munich Central Train Station serves about 450,000 passengers a day, which puts it on par with other large stations in Germany. Munich Central Train Station alongside M\u00fcnchen Ost railway station are two of the 21 stations in Germany classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 1 station.\r\nThe central mainline station is a terminal station with 32 platforms. The subterranean S-Bahn with 2 platforms and U-Bahn stations with 6 platforms are through stations.The Intercity-Express (ICE) stop at Munich Central Train Station. InterCity and EuroCity trains to destinations east of Munich also stop at the M\u00fcnchen Ost railway station. Munich is connected to Nuremberg via Ingolstadt by the Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway and Berlin\u2013Munich high-speed railway.The old air raid shelter next to platform 11 of Munich Central Train Station was an important distribution point for guest workers (Gastarbeiter) between 1960 and 1973. At peak more than 1,000 guest workers arrived per day, in total 1.8 million guest workers passed through Munich Central Train Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Autobahns ===\r\nMunich is an integral part of the Autobahn network of southern Germany. Motorways from Stuttgart (W), Nuremberg, Frankfurt and Berlin (N), Deggendorf and Passau (E), Salzburg and Innsbruck (SE), Garmisch Partenkirchen (S) and Lindau (SW) terminate at Munich, allowing direct access to the different parts of Germany, Austria and Italy.\r\nTraffic is often very heavy in and around Munich.

Traffic congestion are commonplace at the beginning and end of major Bavarian holidays. There are few \"green waves\" or roundabouts, and an abundance of construction sites.Munich has introduced an environmental zone and was among the first German cities to require a green sticker for vehicles, these are an requirement when entering the city or driving in the wider surrounding area.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Air ===\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Munich International Airport ====\r\nFranz Josef Strauss International Airport (IATA: MUC, ICAO: EDDM) is the second-largest airport in Germany and seventh-largest in Europe after London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid and Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk. It is used by about 46 million passengers a year, and lies some 30 km (19 mi) north east of the city centre. It replaced the smaller Munich-Riem Airport in 1992. The airport can be reached by suburban train lines from the city. From the main railway station the journey takes 40\u201345 minutes. An express train will be added that will cut down travel time to 20\u201325 minutes with limited stops on dedicated tracks. A magnetic levitation train (called Transrapid), which was to have run at speeds of up to 400 km/h (249 mph) from the central station to the airport in a travel time of 10 minutes, had been approved, but was cancelled in March 2008 because of cost escalation and after heavy protests. Lufthansa opened its second hub at the airport when Terminal 2 was opened in 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Other airports ====\r\nIn 2008, the Bavarian state government granted a licence to expand Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station located west of Munich, for commercial use. These plans were opposed by many residents in the Oberpfaffenhofen area as well as other branches of local government, including the city of Munich, which took the case to court. However, in October 2009, the permit allowing up to 9725 business flights per year to depart from or land at Oberpfaffenhofen was confirmed by a regional judge.Despite being 110 km (68 mi) from Munich, Memmingen Airport has been advertised as Airport Munich West. After 2005, passenger traffic of nearby Augsburg Airport was relocated to Munich Airport, leaving the Augsburg region of Bavaria without an air passenger airport within close reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Around Munich ==\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Nearby towns ===\r\nThe Munich agglomeration sprawls across the plain of the Alpine foothills comprising about 2.6 million inhabitants. Several smaller traditional Bavarian towns and cities like Dachau, Freising, Erding, Starnberg, Landshut and Moosburg are today part of the Greater Munich Region, formed by Munich and the surrounding districts, making up the Munich Metropolitan Region, which has a population of about 6 million people.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Recreation ===\r\nSouth of Munich, there are numerous nearby freshwater lakes such as Lake Starnberg, Ammersee, Chiemsee, Walchensee, Kochelsee, Tegernsee, Schliersee, Simssee, Staffelsee, W\u00f6rthsee, Kirchsee and the Osterseen (Easter Lakes), which are popular among Munich residents for recreation, swimming and watersports and can be quickly reached by car and a few also by Munich's S-Bahn.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n==
